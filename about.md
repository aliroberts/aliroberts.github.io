Hi! I'm a London-based full-stack software developer and musician. I currently do freelance work for clients who want help developing applications with a machine learning/natural language processing/information retrieval flavour.

I also occasionally work with UCL's NLP group as a Visiting Researcher. Checkout some [recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00293.pdf) that I contributed to that's pending publication in TACL.

If you'd like to get in touch, please email me at <ali.roberts3@gmail.com>
