## About Me

Hi, I'm **Ali Roberts**. I'm passionate about creating things that live at the intersection of hardware and software. This blog is where I share my experiments, projects, and thoughts on technology, design, and making.

## What I Do

I work on a variety of projects that combine:

- **Hardware prototyping** - From Arduino projects to custom PCBs
- **Software development** - Web applications, embedded systems, and automation
- **Design thinking** - User experience, industrial design, and creative problem solving
- **Open source** - Contributing to and building tools that others can use

## About This Blog

**Bits & Pieces** is my digital workshop where I document:

- Project tutorials and guides
- Technical deep-dives
- Design process insights
- Lessons learned from failures and successes
- Tools and resources I find useful

The name reflects my approach to building things - combining various "bits and pieces" of technology, knowledge, and creativity to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

## Design Philosophy

This site is built with a **Bauhaus-inspired aesthetic** - emphasizing:

- **Function over form** - Every element serves a purpose
- **Geometric clarity** - Clean lines and structured layouts
- **Bold typography** - Clear hierarchy and readability
- **Playful minimalism** - Simple but not sterile

Think Dieter Rams meets modern web design, with a touch of whimsy.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow makers, developers, and creative technologists. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, discuss a project, or just say hello.
